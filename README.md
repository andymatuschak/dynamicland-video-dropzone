# Dynamicland video upload service

This little webserver lets you bridge physical to digital to physical video in [Dynamicland](http://dynamicland.org): visit the webserver root on a smartphone, upload a video, and Dynamicland's printer will spit out a physical program which causes the video to be projected onto its surface.

This is only really relevant to Dynamicland visitors.
